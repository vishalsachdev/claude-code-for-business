# Exercise 8: Your Capstone Project

**Time:** 2-4 hours (at your own pace)
**Difficulty:** You choose
**You'll build:** A custom tool for YOUR business idea

---

## What This Exercise Is

This is your graduation project. You'll apply everything from the course to build a tool that solves a real problem YOU have.

There's no starter data. No step-by-step instructions. Just you, Claude Code, and a problem worth solving.

---

## How to Approach This

### Step 1: Choose Your Project

Pick a problem you actually have. Some questions to help:

- What task do you do repeatedly that feels tedious?
- What data do you have that you're not using?
- What tool do you wish existed but can't find?
- What would impress someone in your target industry?

### Step 2: Scope It Down

Your first instinct will be to build too much. Resist it.

**The Scoping Exercise:**
1. List everything your dream tool would do
2. Cross off 75% of it
3. What's left is your MVP
4. If it still feels big, cross off more

**Good scope:** Something you can complete in 2-4 hours
**Too big:** Anything requiring multiple user types, complex authentication, or real-time processing

### Step 3: Plan Before You Build

Before opening Claude Code, write down:

1. **The problem:** One sentence describing what you're solving
2. **The user:** Who will use this (even if it's just you)
3. **The core feature:** The ONE thing it must do well
4. **Input:** What data/files will it need
5. **Output:** What will it produce

### Step 4: Build Incrementally

Don't try to build everything at once.

1. Get the core functionality working first
2. Test it with real data
3. Add features one at a time
4. Stop when it's useful, not perfect

### Step 5: Document What You Built

Create a README for your project:
- What it does
- How to use it
- What you learned building it

---

## Project Template

Create a folder for your project with this structure:

```
my-project/
├── README.md          # What it does, how to use it
├── data/              # Any input files
├── src/               # Code files
└── output/            # Generated results
```

### README Template

```markdown
# [Your Project Name]

## The Problem
[One sentence: What problem does this solve?]

## The Solution
[2-3 sentences: What does your tool do?]

## How to Use

1. Put your data in the `data/` folder
2. Run: `python src/main.py`
3. Find results in `output/`

## Example

[Show what the output looks like]

## What I Learned

[2-3 things you learned building this]

## Future Improvements

[If you had more time, what would you add?]
```

## Evaluation Criteria (For Yourself)

Grade your project on:

### Usefulness (Does it solve a real problem?)
- Would you actually use this?
- Does it save time or provide insights?

### Completeness (Does the core feature work?)
- Can it handle real data?
- Does it produce useful output?

### Polish (Is it pleasant to use?)
- Clear instructions?
- Handles errors gracefully?
- Output is well-formatted?

### Learning (Did you grow?)
- Did you try something new?
- What would you do differently next time?

---

## Stuck? Common Issues

### "I don't know what to build"
Pick the first idea that sounds interesting. Don't overthink. The skills transfer regardless of the project.

### "My idea is too big"
Cut it in half. Then cut it in half again. What's the smallest version that's still useful?

### "I keep hitting errors"
Normal! Tell Claude what's happening. "When I do X, I get error Y. Can you help?" Error-fixing is part of building.

### "It works but it's ugly"
Ship it anyway! Ugly and working beats pretty and incomplete. Polish is a luxury for version 2.

### "I want to keep adding features"
Stop. Your MVP is done when the core feature works. Write down future ideas in your README.

## Sharing Your Work

### In Your Portfolio
- GitHub repo with clear README
- Screenshots of your tool in action
- Link in your LinkedIn projects section

### In Interviews
- "I built a tool that solves [problem]"
- "It uses AI-assisted development through Claude Code"
- "Here's a demo..."

### With This Course Community
- Share your project in [community discussion channel]
- Help others who are stuck on similar problems
- Get feedback to improve

## What You've Accomplished

If you've made it here and completed a capstone project, you've:

✅ Learned to install and use Claude Code
✅ Mastered the conversation-as-programming paradigm
✅ Built tools for data analysis, automation, and research
✅ Created a functional web prototype
✅ Applied everything to build something original

You're no longer a beginner. You're a builder.

## What's Next?

### Keep Building
The best way to get better is to keep building. Every project teaches you something new.

### Share Your Knowledge
Teach someone else what you learned. It solidifies your own understanding.

### Explore Advanced Topics
- API integrations
- Database connections
- More complex web applications
- Scheduling and automation

### Stay Connected
- Follow Claude Code updates
- Join the community
- Share what you build
