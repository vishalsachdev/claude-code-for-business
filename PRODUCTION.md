## Ideation Log

### 2024-12-25 — Initial Ideation Session

**Core Concept:**
A course teaching business students to use Claude Code for building practical tools. Focus on business applications (not developer workflows). Students go from "never used terminal" to "built working tools."

**Key Decisions Made:**
- 8 videos covering setup → data → automation → prototyping → capstone
- Full GitHub repo with starter files and solutions
- Mixed video style: face cam + screen recording
- Each video produces a tangible tool students can use

**Course Arc:**
1. First Contact (setup + quick win)
2. Collaboration Paradigm (how to communicate with AI)
3. Data & Documents (spreadsheet analysis)
4. Automation (repeatable scripts)
5. Market Research (competitive intelligence)
6. Content & Marketing (content repurposing)
7. Prototyping (simple web dashboards)
8. Capstone (student's own project)

**Teaching Philosophy Notes:**
- Business problem first, technical concept second
- Every video ends with something that works
- Show the iterations and mistakes (authenticity)
- Leverage 15 years of teaching experience for clear explanations

**Open Questions at This Stage:**
- Video hosting: YouTube only or also course platform?
- Community: Discord/forum for student projects?
- Monetization: Free launch, premium later?
