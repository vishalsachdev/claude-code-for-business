## Choosing Your Project

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **What repetitive task do you do every week?**
   That's probably a good automation candidate.

2. **What data do you have that you're not using?**
   Build a tool to extract insights from it.

3. **What tool do you wish existed?**
   Build a simple version of it.

4. **What would impress your future employer?**
   Build something relevant to your target industry.

### Scope Tips

**Start small:**
- Pick ONE core feature
- Get it working end-to-end
- Add features only after the core works

**Good scope:**
- Accomplishable in 2-4 hours
- Produces useful output
- Solves a real problem you have

**Too big (save for later):**
- Multiple user types
- Real-time data processing
- Integration with many external services
